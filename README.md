# Welcome

{% hint style="warning" %}
I translated the Nishikoto organization's documentation into English using only my knowledge and a translation application. If there are any translation errors, please let me know [by my discord](https://discord.com/invite/rqcNfD2s2K) or correct them yourself [by github (fork)](https://github.com/orgNishikoto/docs/fork).
{% endhint %}

It's easy to read documentation, but less easy to understand it, so I'll make sure it's easy to integrate.
